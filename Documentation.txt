First of all, thank you for allowing me to participate in the assignment. I am working on Assignment 2 for the Frontend Developer role.
I have nearly completed the assignment and I have a few doubts regarding the same. It will be helpful if you clear my doubts

1. For the "role" column, I have used a dropdown menu (to select either "admin" or "member" while editing the row). Please let me know if any changes are required

2. I have also applied dynamic changes for the next-page and previous-page buttons.
For instance, on the last page, the next-page button will disappear and similarly, on the first page, the previous-page button will disappear
If there is any need to apply these dynamic changes in the first-page button & last-page button, please let me know.

3. I could not find the "Delete Selected" button in the image on the instruction page. I have put it at the bottom left. Please check the attached image. If you want me to place it in any particular position, then please let me know.

4. What is the functionality of the "Bulk Delete" button at the top right corner? I could not find it on the instructions page

If there are any other suggestions, please tell me.

Warm Regards
